- 👋 Hi, I’m @pierre-auguste
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D (blender, unreal engine, webGL, ...), PHP, Linux, a little of C++ (but templating is hard).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to live outside my computer.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to discover your sources to learn how it's done.
- 📫 How to reach me ? Late at night.
